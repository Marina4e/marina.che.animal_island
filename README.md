Develop a model of an island with variable parameters, consisting of an array of locations
 (e.g. 100x20 cells - but you can change the size of the island in the game console!). 
The locations will be filled with vegetation and animals.

The animals can:

-eat plants and/or other animals (if there is suitable food in their location);
-move (to neighboring locations);
-reproduce (if there is a pair in their location);
-starve to death or be eaten.

Implemented:
1.animal Hierarchy (OOP);
2.animal behavior;
3.multithreading (schedule);
4.statistics on island state at each cycle (in console).
